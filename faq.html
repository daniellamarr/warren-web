            Almost! There are already so many hassle and fee in financial services, and we don't want to add to the friction. So we change a very small fee, but you don't pay for distributor's commission, as your investment goes into direct (zero-commission) mutual funds.

            Warren is a financial services firm which is registered in Nigeria by CAC with RC Number:             1583084. In addition to investing your money in risk-free instruments, invested assets are held by CORDROS CAPITAL, a company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on behalf of INVESTORS. These assets are marked to market periodically to ensure customers are not exposed.
            ALSO your monies never touch WARREN Bank account and are directly invested with one of the largest AMFs regulated by SEC. The details of the transactions are always made known to you at every step of the process.

            <h3>Is my Data safe and secure with Warren?</h3>
            At Warren we take data security very seriously. All data on devices (in the apps) or in transit use strong encryption, particularly transaction data. As a regulated entity we follow strong compliance guidelines along with our partner AMCs and payment gateways. Our servers are hosted in a private cloud for high protection against attacks.

            <h3>How Does Warren make money?</h3>
            Currently, Warren is completely free, and we don't make money from customer transactions or from the AMF. As a platform for direct (zero-commission) mutual funds, we don't get commissions from the mutual fund houses. Naturally, you might wonder how we plan to keep Warren running without commission. The answer is, in future, we plan to introduce few advisory and value-added services, which might be chargeable.

            Mutual Funds is a collection of your funds with thousands of other funds invested by trusted Financial Institutions (FI) and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The funds are invested in various places such as deposits, bonds, and stocks in order to grow and make a profit.

            <h3>Why are Credit Cards not allowed for Payments?</h3>
            Transactions through Credit cards can create a scenario where one can create financial assets without actually having monies to back it up with.
